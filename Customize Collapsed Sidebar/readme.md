# Customize Collapsed Sidebar

This mod allows for extensive customization of the collapsed sidebar. By default, it sets everything to the pre-1.13b sizing, but you can adjust most things to your liking!

Do note that this will break when folders are released, I will work on updating this when they are.

Install with [Sine](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine) for easy customization!

You can also paste the code in your user chrome and it should just work as is!

You can tweak the options in about:config by looking for mod.ccs
